# R package 'seg'

The seg package is a collection of segregation measures developed in the geographical and sociological literature. Implemented measures range from simple, traditional methods like the index of dissimilarity (1955) to more sophisticated, spatial approaches such as Reardon and O'Sullivan's spatial segregation measures (2004). If you think I have missed any important methods in the field, or if you have any suggestions or new ideas to make existing features better, please do not hesitate to email me at hong.seongyun [at] gmail.com. Reported bugs will be fixed as soon as possible. All other suggestions will be considered when preparing for the next update. Please note however that I work on this package mainly in my spare time, so updates may not be as frequent as I would like. My aim is to have at least two updates every year (one in May and the other in November).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/syunhong/seg/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
